Phishing URL Detection
###
This project is designed for the detection of phishing URLs using a machine learning model based on features extracted from the URLs. The model is implemented using a Gradient Boosting Classifier.

##
Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:

###
Feature Extraction:

The feature extraction module is responsible for gathering relevant features from a given URL. The FeatureExtraction class in the feature.py file implements various methods to extract features.

###
Gradient Boosting Model:
The machine learning model is implemented using the Gradient Boosting Classifier. The training of the model is done in the GradientBoost.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

###
Prediction:
The predict.py script allows users to input a URL and receive a prediction from the trained model regarding whether the URL is potentially phishing or not.

###
Web Interface:
The project includes a simple web interface for users to interact with the model. The interface is implemented using Flask and can be accessed by running the app.py script.



##
Programming Language:

###
Python:
The core programming language used for implementing the URL phishing detection.
Libraries and Frameworks:

###
Scikit-learn:
 Used for machine learning tasks, particularly for implementing the Gradient Boosting model for URL phishing prediction.
###
BeautifulSoup:
Used for web scraping and extracting information from HTML content.
###
Requests:
Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.
###
Whois:
 Used for retrieving WHOIS information about domain registration.
###
Googlesearch:
 Used for performing Google searches programmatically.
###
ipaddress:
 Used for working with IP addresses.
###
Flask:
 A web framework used for building the web interface and handling HTTP requests.

##
Machine Learning Model:
###
Gradient Boosting Model: Trained and implemented using the Scikit-learn library for predicting whether a given URL is a phishing URL or not.
Web Development:

##
Flask Web Framework:
Used for building the web application that allows users to input a URL and get predictions.
##
Web Technologies:

###
HTML:
Used for structuring the web page.
###
CSS:
 Used for styling the web page and applying colors based on phishing prediction results.
###
Jinja2:
A templating engine used with Flask for embedding Python code in HTML.
Data Analysis and Feature Extraction:

###
Pandas:
While not explicitly mentioned in your provided code, Pandas is a common library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. If data frames are used for feature extraction or analysis, Pandas may be involved.
###
Other Utilities:

###
Regular Expressions (Regex):
Used for pattern matching and extracting specific information from strings.
Make sure to include these technologies and tools in your project's documentation or README file, providing information on how to set up and run the project. Additionally, mention any specific versions of the libraries and frameworks used.
